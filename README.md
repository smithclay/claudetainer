> Production-ish Claude Code workflows, packaged in a friendly [dev container](https://containers.dev/).

Opinionated [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) workflows: built-in instructions, slash commands, and hooks for common programming languages with built-in remote session and tmux support. Created for using Claude Code from anywhere (even your phone).

claudetainer **doesn't change your system or existing Claude Code configuration**: everything runs inside of an isolated Docker container using Anthrophic's [Claude Code dev container feature](https://github.com/anthropics/devcontainer-features). Opinionated configuration ("presets") are opt-in. You can just use claudetainer as a simple way to isolate Claude Code if you like.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under 60 seconds on Linux, macOS or WSL:

### Option 1: Download Binary (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Download and install latest release
curl -L https://github.com/smithclay/claudetainer/releases/latest/download/claudetainer -o claudetainer
chmod +x claudetainer && sudo mv claudetainer /usr/local/bin/

cd ~/your-project # node, python, go, rust, shell (PRs welcome for others)

# 2. Initialize your project (auto-detects language)
claudetainer init

# 3. Start your container
claudetainer up

# 4. Connect via SSH with multiplexer
claudetainer ssh
```

### Option 2: Homebrew

```bash
# 1. Add the tap and install
brew tap smithclay/tap
brew install claudetainer

cd ~/your-project # node, python, go, rust, shell (PRs welcome for others)

## Language Support

Claudetainer automatically detects your project type and configures the right tools:

| Language | Detection Files | Tools Included | Key Features |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Python** | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` | black, flake8, autopep8 | Smart-lint pipeline, FastAPI patterns |
| **Node.js** | `package.json` | eslint, prettier | TypeScript support, npm/yarn detection |
| **Go** | `go.mod` | gofmt, golangci-lint | Module-aware linting |
| **Rust** | `Cargo.toml` | rustfmt, clippy | Cargo integration |
| **Shell** | `*.sh`, `install.sh`, `setup.sh`, `build.sh` | shellcheck, shfmt | POSIX/bash dialect detection, security linting |

Don't see your language? Don't like the prompts? Claudetainer is [extensible](#extending-claudetainer) - create custom presets or request new ones.

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Homebrew Package Manager

**macOS & Linux**

```bash
# Add the tap (one-time setup)
brew tap smithclay/tap

# Install claudetainer
brew install claudetainer

# Updates are easy
brew upgrade claudetainer
```

### Option 2: Direct Download

**Any Unix system** - Fallback installation method:

```bash
# Download the latest release
curl -L https://github.com/smithclay/claudetainer/releases/latest/download/claudetainer -o claudetainer

# Make executable and install
chmod +x claudetainer
sudo mv claudetainer /usr/local/bin/
```

### Option 3: Direct Dev Container Feature

Add to your existing `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/smithclay/claudetainer/claudetainer:latest": {
      "include": "python",
      "includeBase": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Workflows

### Python app development example

Coming soon.

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Presets - use your own standards

Don't like the defaults or want to override them?

Just reference a remote repository under `include` in `.devcontainer/.devcontainer.json` after running `claudetainer init`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "claudetainer": {
      "include": [
        "python",
        "github:acme-corp/claude-standards/python",
        "github:acme-corp/claude-standards/security"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Now everyone on your team gets the same linting rules, commands, and best practices automatically. 

More details are in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

### CLI Commands

Claudetainer provides a complete set of commands for container lifecycle management:

```bash
# Project setup
claudetainer init [language]    # Create devcontainer (auto-detects language)
claudetainer up                 # Start container (creates if missing)
claudetainer start              # Same as up

# Container management  
claudetainer ssh                # Connect with tmux session
claudetainer list               # List running containers (aliases: ps, ls)
claudetainer rm                 # Remove containers for this project
claudetainer rm --config        # Also remove .devcontainer directory
claudetainer rm -f              # Force removal without confirmation

# Debugging and health
claudetainer doctor             # Comprehensive health check
claudetainer prereqs            # Check prerequisites

# Manual SSH access
ssh -p 2223 vscode@localhost    # Password: vscode
```

### SSH Development

Connect to your container from any terminal:

```bash
claudetainer ssh
```

Includes tmux for persistent sessions that survive disconnections: perfect for talking to Claude Code from your iPhone.

## Requirements

- **Docker** - For dev container support
- **DevContainer CLI** - `npm install -g @devcontainers/cli`
- **git** - For GitHub preset support
- Claude Code and dev tools are installed automatically via dev container images and features.

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ devcontainer-gen.sh # DevContainer JSON generation
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/               # Command implementations (7 modules)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ doctor.sh          # Health check and diagnostics
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ init.sh            # Project initialization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ up.sh              # Container startup
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ssh.sh             # SSH connection management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rm.sh              # Container removal
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ list.sh            # Container listing
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ prereqs.sh         # Prerequisites checking
â””â”€â”€ dist/                   # Build output (gitignored)
    â””â”€â”€ claudetainer        # Single-file distribution (1,435 lines)
```

### Build System
- **Development**: Use modular `./bin/claudetainer` for development
- **Distribution**: Run `./build.sh` to create `dist/claudetainer` (single file)
- **CI/CD**: Both versions tested automatically in GitHub Actions
- **Size**: Reduced main script from 1,277 to 143 lines (89% reduction!)

### Installation Methods
1. **Download Binary** (recommended): Single file from GitHub releases
2. **Homebrew**: Via `smithclay/tap` (when available)  
3. **Development**: Clone repo and use `./bin/claudetainer` directly
