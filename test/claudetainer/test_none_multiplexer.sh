# It should check that no multiplexer is installed and simple environment is configured

# Test 1: Check that tmux is NOT installed (optional - it might be installed by base image)
# We don't fail if tmux exists, but we verify our config doesn't use it

# Test 2: Check that zellij is NOT installed (optional - it might be installed by base image)
# We don't fail if zellij exists, but we verify our config doesn't use it

# Test 3: Check that auto-start is configured in bashrc

# Test 4: Check that auto-start script exists

# Test 5: Check that auto-start script does NOT contain tmux commands
